# Gym Database

This is a full stack application to help keep track of members and employees of
many gyms.

The database (not directly part of this repo) is a MySQL database. The backend
is with Java. The frontend is with regular HTML/CSS and JavaScript.

Find the SQL insert and select statements in [`src/main/java/com/example/gymdb/InsertSelectStatements.java`](https://github.com/khanhtruong0808/gym-db/blob/main/src/main/java/com/example/gymdb/InsertSelectStatements.java)
